This version works on systems with PulseAudio installed . Wrong settings can produce clipping from the pulseaudio. For good quality sound please consider ALSA with hw mixer
<br>
<br>

## Usage

run command from terminal
```
./audiopowertool.py
```

## Prerequisites

this should cover everything
```
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

## Troubleshoot

Cannot run the app ? Make it executable with a command
```
chmod +x audiopowertool.py
```
