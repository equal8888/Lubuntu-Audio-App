 <strong>Current Development stage 0.4 </strong> ðŸ˜”
<br>
<br>
Tested on Lubuntu (16.04 LTS) Don't set sample rate to "maximum option available", that will do audio resampling and you don't want that!
<br>

## Usage

run command from terminal
```
./Ubuntu-Audio-App.py
```

## Prerequisites

this should cover everything
```
sudo apt-get install python3-tk
```

## Troubleshoot

chmod some files on app root directory
```
chmod +x  Ubuntu-Audio-App/*
```
